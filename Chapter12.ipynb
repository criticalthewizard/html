In this chapter, we will take a closer look at how you can use <b>class, id, span</b> and <b>div</b> to specify properties for selected elements. How can you color one particular headline differently than the other headlines on your website? How can you group your links into different categories and give each category a special style? These are just examples of questions we will answer in this chapter."
