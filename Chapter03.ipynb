    "In this lesson, you will learn how to create links. To make links, you use what you always use when coding HTML: an element. A simple element with one attribute and you will be able to link to anything and everything. Here is an example of what a link to EngineeringU.com would look like:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/90219577/Hermon/CSE_Website/webdev/03/EU1.png\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://www.engineeringu.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The greatest website on the internet\">EngineeringU.com</a><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The element <b>a</b> stands for \"anchor\". And the attribute <b>href</b> is short for \"hypertext reference\", which specifies where the link leads. This is typically an address on the internet or a file name. In the above example the attribute href has the value \"http://www.engineeringU.com\", which is the full address of EngineeringU.com and is called a <b>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</b>. Note that <b>\"http://\"</b> must always be included in URLs. The sentence \"Visit EngineeringU.com\" is the text that is shown in the browser as the link. Remember to close the element with an <b>&lt;/a&gt;</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also used the <b>target</b> attribute which tells the browser how to open the URL. <b>target=\"_blank\"</b> will open the URL in a new window or tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we used the <b>title</b> attribute which is used to type a short description of the link. If you - without clicking - place the cursor over the link, you will see the text \"The greatest website on the internet\" appears."

On your server put your Page2.html file in your <b>img</b> folder and now try your links. You will notice that they are now broken.
