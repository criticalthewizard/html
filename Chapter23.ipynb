    "<h3>Example 1: Retrieving Data</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve data from a database, you use queries. An example of a query could be: \"get all data from the table 'people' sorted alphabetically\" or \"get names from the table 'people'\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the language Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to communicate with the database. Let's look at each line of the code below which shows how data in the table \"people\" is retrieved with an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first write the query on line 6 as a <b>SELECT</b> statement. The <b>'*'</b> is used to select all of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "On line 9 we execute the query which returns a result in the form of a series of records which we stored in <b>&#36;result</b>. These records are stored in a so-called recordset. A recordset can be described as a kind of table in the server's memory, containing rows of data (records), and each record is subdivided into individual fields (or columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "A recordset can be compared to a table where each record could be compared to a row in the table. On lines 23-26, we ran through the recordset with a loop and the function <b>mysql_fetch_array</b>, which returns each row as an array. We access each element of the array by using the column headings. In this loop we concatenated strings and variables with dots <b>(.)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper protocol is to start your file by accessing the database, retrieving your data and then closing the connection before you start your HTML page. Then you can use your PHP loop within your HTML when you want to print the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Often it can be helpful if a list or table of data is presented alphabetically, chronologically or numerically. Such sorting is very easy to do with SQL, where the syntax <b>Order By ColumnName</b> is used to sort according to the column contents.\n",
    "\n",

    "Say, we only want to retrieve people from the database who have the last name \"Dumbledore\". That could be done like this:\n",

On the same page as the form you created in the last actvity create an update form which will eventually pass data to a file called <b>update.php</b>. Let the user select from an alphabetized by last name dropdown list of wizards. The data that should be passed to the update form however, should be the <b>id</b> of the wizard. Our final chapter will show you how to <b>DELETE</b> data from our database. So, once your update form is created you could duplicate it to make a delete form that sends the data to a file called <b>delete.php</b> </font>\n",
