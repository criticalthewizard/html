An element which is positioned <b>absolute</b> does not obtain any space in the document. This means that it does not leave an empty space after being positioned. To position an element absolutely, the <b>position</b> property is set as <b>absolute</b>. You can subsequently use the properties <b>left, right, top,</b> and <b>bottom</b> to place the box.\n",

    "The position for an element which is relatively positioned is calculated from the original position in the document. That means that you move the element to the right, to the left, up or down. This way, the element still obtains a space in the document after it is positioned.\n",

    "<font size=\"+0\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no assigned task at this time for this course, however for those interested in a challenge or those thinking about a career in Web Development an excellent independent project to consider to further hone your CSS skills would be to try out the <a href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CSS Zen Garden</a>, a website that was launched in May of 2003. The CSS Zen Garden is a World Wide Web development resource. The goal of the site is to showcase what is possible with CSS-based design. Style sheets contributed by graphic designers from around the world are used to change the visual presentation of a single HTML file, producing hundreds of different designs. Aside from reference to an external CSS file, the HTML markup itself never changes. All visual differences are the result of the CSS (and supporting imagery). You simply download the single HTML file from their website and then work on a CSS file that will style the page. For years I've thought about trying to see what I could design but have never had the time. Pure procrastination I guess! If any of you ever accomplish a CSS Zen Garden styling sheet please share your work with me so I can include it in this book for future students.</font>\n",
