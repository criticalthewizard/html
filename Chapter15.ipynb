    "<h3>What is PHP?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "PHP was originally an acronym for <b>Personal Home Pages</b>, but is now a recursive acronym for <b>Hypertext Preprocessor</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "PHP was originally developed by the Danish Greenlander Rasmus Lerdorf, and was subsequently developed as open source. PHP is not a proper web standard - but an open-source technology. PHP is neither real programming language - but PHP lets you use so-called scripting in your HTML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe what a PHP page is, you could say that it is a file with the extension .php that contains a combination of HTML tags and scripts that run on a web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does PHP work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to explain how PHP works is by comparing it with standard HTML. Imagine you type the address of an HTML document (e.g. http://www.mysite.com/page.htm) in the address line of the browser. This way you request an HTML page. The server simply sends an HTML file to the client. But if you instead type http://www.mysite.com/page.php - and thus request a PHP page, the server first reads the PHP file carefully to see if there are any tasks that need to be executed. Only when the server has done what it is supposed to do, the result is then sent to the client. It is important to understand that the client only sees the result of the server's work (an HTML file), not the actual instructions (PHP).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>This means a couple of things:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) You won't be able to test your <b>.php</b> page simply by dropping it on the browser because PHP is actually run on the server. From now on you will have to FTP your <b>.php</b> pages to your server space to see if it is working as expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.) This means that if you click \"view source\" on a PHP page, you do not see the PHP codes - only basic HTML tags. Therefore, you cannot see how a PHP page is made by using \"view source\". You have to learn PHP in other ways, for example, by taking this course and of course always having the skills to read and understand the official...\n",

    "Start by making an ordinary HTML document like the following, but name the file <b>page.php</b> and upload it to your server. Notice, we have a normal HTML page and even some CSS for the <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> element. The difference is there is a line of PHP. Let's examine how PHP is included in an HTML document.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to tell the server when the PHP will start and end. In PHP you use the tags <b>&lt;?php</b> and <b>?&gt;</b> to mark the start and end for the PHP codes that the server must execute (on most servers it will be suficient to use just <b>&lt;?</b> as start tag, but <b>&lt;?php</b> is the most correct to use the first time PHP is used.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You might find PHP easy to learn because of your already strong grasp of Python. When we wanted to print something on the screen in Python we used <b>print</b>. In PHP we use <b>echo</b>. Since we want to print some HTML which is technically a string we include it in quotations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<u>Why didn't we just use regular HTML</u>???? DUH! Because we are trying to learn PHP!!! Imagine if the text was in a variable sent to this page by a form. We could \"echo\" the variable onto the page and it would always print whatever was entered in the form. So yes, if we were actually going to hard-code text into our HTML the PHP line would have been a waste of time."
