    "In most languages, there is an alternative to the <b>If-Else</b> structure called <b>Switch-Case</b>. The reason you might not have heard of it is because unfortunately, Python is one of the only languages without it. Python was a great starting language but unfortunately it might bias you towards always using the <b>If-Else</b> structure when most programmers use the <b>Switch-Case</b> method. I would recommend you give it a chance and try to become knowledgeable in it's syntax. I will provide a couple of examples below but here is more <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.switch.php\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is based on an expression and then lists different \"answers\" or \"cases\" with related statements. Notice in the following example the <b>switch expression</b> is a variable which we can see is \"Voldemort\". The server checks through each <b>case</b> to see if one matches. If it does, the statement(s) within that case are executed. The <b>break;</b> statements are used to tell the server to not waste time checking any more of the <b>case</b> statements. If you want the server to continue to check <b>case</b> statements you could remove the <b>break;</b>. The final <b>case</b> is actually <b>default</b> and will execute if none of the previous <b>cases</b> are true.\n",
